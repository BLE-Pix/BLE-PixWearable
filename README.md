# BLE-PixWearable
BLE-Pix (Pronounced bloo piks and originally spelled BluPix) is the next generation concept of the Pixel Maker App invented by Tasha Bingman.  This new version provides a similar UI (BLE-PixMaker) using all new code in Python using Kivy to support more clients. The supported hardware also changed to the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit and Adafruit Bicolor LED Square Pixel Matrix.  This enabled  the programs to be changed so that rather than downloading compiled code (BLE-PixWearable) from the UI, the UI can just send new instructions for the pixel animations to display via BLE with 3 colors and off making 4 states supported instead of the previous on/off monocolor states.
